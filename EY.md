## âœ… Java Programming

### âž¤ Core Java & OOPs

* What is method Overloading and method Overriding?
* Difference between abstraction and interface?
* What is this and super keyword? Can we use both in the same method and constructor? 
  <details>
  <summary>What is type casting and its types?</summary>
    JavascriptExecutor js = (JavascriptExecutor)driver; // Cast WebDriver â†’ JS Executor
    
    String title = (String)js.executeScript("return document.title"); // Cast Object â†’ String
  </details>

* What are Constructors in Java?
* What does super() keyword do in Java?
* Can you explain the difference between throw and throws in Java?
* What is the purpose of the static keyword in Java?
* What collection topics have you used in your framework?
* Difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?


### âž¤ Coding Challenges
* WJP to count the occurrence of each character in a string
* WJP to convert LinkedList to HashSet
* WJP for given strings are anagram or not: str1="tomato", str2="matoto"
* WJP to remove duplicates from given string| str1="automation" â†’ "automin" | Input="characters" â†’ Output="chartes"
* String problem: Input -> "aaAAbbCCddd" â†’ Output: "a2A2C2d3"
* Write function to find the sum of distinct elements in an array
* Print each letter twice: Input="hello" â†’ Output="hheelllloo"
* Count odd and even numbers from array
* Swap two strings without third variable

### âž¤ Selenium Basics

<details>
  <summary>Explain Selenium3 vs Selenium4 architecture</summary>
Test Script
   â†“
WebDriver API
   â†“  (JSON Wire Protocol)
Browser Driver
   â†“  (translates to W3C)
Browser


Test Script
   â†“
WebDriver API
   â†“  (W3C Protocol â€” native)
Browser Driver
   â†“
Browser

Selenium 3: WebDriver speaks one language (JSON Wire), browser drivers speak another (W3C), so translation is needed.
Selenium 4: Everyone speaks the same language (W3C protocol) â€” more reliable communication.
</details>

* Difference between RemoteDriver and WebDriver
ðŸ”¹ WebDriver (Interface)
It's a top-level interface in Selenium.
Provides the main methods like .get(), .click(), .findElement(), etc.
Implemented by many browser-specific classes:
WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver();  // local testing
ðŸ”¹ RemoteWebDriver (Class)
A concrete class that implements the WebDriver interface.
Used when running tests remotely, e.g.:
On a Selenium Grid
On cloud services like BrowserStack, Sauce Labs
Communicates via the WebDriver protocol (HTTP).
WebDriver driver = new RemoteWebDriver(new URL("http://localhost:4444/wd/hub"), options);

* What is JavaScriptExecutor, when to use it? Write syntax
* Difference between get() and navigate.to()
* Syntax to take screenshot & type casting used
* Syntax for performing "Control + A"
* Difference between build() and perform()
* How to perform right-click operation?
